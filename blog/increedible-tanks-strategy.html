          <h2>What is this Article For?</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>
            Some levels of Increedible Tanks are hard. Many people die on levels such as 6, 10, 20, 30, and 33. These are all levels designed to be difficult. Sometimes you make thing the game is too hard, but every level has it's weaknesses. This article will give you tips to find and use those weaknesses to your advantage. 
          </p>
          <h2>The Toolkit</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>Toolkits are extremely useful in any level. For levels where it is hard to dodge enemy fire, toolkits are the way to survive. You can buy toolkits in the shop. They cost 500 gold. Toolkits heal you to 75% health, but only if you are lower than it. Use the "Q" key to use a toolkit. It is best to use toolkits when you are at low health, however healing right before you die is risky. Toolkits have a cooldown of 30 seconds, so you are not able to spam heal. This is the easiest method to beat a level, because it requires no skill.</p>
          <h2>Classic Dodging</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>This method is much harder than the Toolkit. Everyone should do this, because if you cant heal, dodging is your best chance. One tip is to always be moving. Staying still allows enemies to locate and fire at you. It reduces your chances of escape. Moving around the level in a circle shape is the best way. It makes it so you enemies have to go around the entire level. Using boosts can help you dodge too. Boosts are available in the shop and cost 50 coins. Use the Shift key to use a boost. Boosts increase your speed from 2 to 8 for a fraction of a second. This allows you to quickly dodge a bullet. Be careful not to boost into bullets, its a fast way to die.</p>
          <h2>Blocks</h2>
          <hr>    
          <p>Blocks are good for blocking bullets or trapping enemies. You can place a block based on your mouse angle. They are available from the shop for 200 coins. Hit space to use. Blocks can trap computer controlled tanks and players. It prevent them from moving and can block 2 shots. If you have no boosts and cannot escape a bullet, you can place a block on it. This will take the bullet damage for you. Another way you can use the block is placing it on a enemy. The computer controlled tanks are stupid, and will not fire once they are stuck. However, you have a 5 second cooldown for placing them.</p>
          <h2>Firing Back</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>Although this seems obvious, sometimes when you are being shot at your only goal is to escape. Firing back at enemies can make them no longer a threat. Real players will try to avoid your bullets, but computer controlled tanks will take your shots. This is a good method for covering your retreat.
          <h2>Finally...</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>Seperate, all these methods are useful, but combined they pose a greater threat. Try boosting toward a enemy and then placing a block on them. Or try doging enemy fire to get close enough to place a block. See what kind of combos you can invent.</p>
